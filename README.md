# Titanic-Disaster-Machine-Learning-Predictive-Model
This repository is a predictive machine learning model for the Titanic Disaster.The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
In other to make a predictive model for disasters like this, a supervised learning with the use of classification will be used to create and train a model which can predict if one will survive or not base on the indiviuals details.
